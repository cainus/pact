The purpose of the pact project is to make unit-testing of node.js apps a little easier/nicer.


What's wrong with the existing way?
- You shouldn't need to run make/rake to find and run all tests when node.js has all the facilities 
for a test runner.
- It's much nicer to have pretty test-reporting, for test code hygiene, CI support, developer motivation
- Tests could be better organized if all the tests for a module are in a single file like "module.test.js" but 
still segregated properly within that file.
- There's little support for the testing of asynchronous code, making it tedious.
- I want to test browser-based apps in node.js as well! 



Goals: 

A TestRunner that can: 
- find your files named x.test.js or test-x.js and run them.
- aggregate results and then report in verbose and simple modes
- run tests in the style of the node.js tests, as well as any new style developed for pact
- report in clover format (for continuous integration)

A TestSuite that can:
- be used to bundle a bunch of tests together (and possibly other suites)
- allow multiple tests in the same file
- can be run by the pact TestRunner

A Test library that can:
- be used for better matching (ie hamcrest?)
- be used for testing of asynchronous code
- be used for BDD support?
- duplicate browser capability for server-side running of browser tests
